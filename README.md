Scam Website Simulation: Maybank Example (For Educational Use Only)
Project Overview
This project is a scammer scenario simulation developed for the Multimedia Forensic and Security course. It demonstrates how scammers might replicate legitimate websites to deceive users into sharing sensitive information. The website mimics the branding of a well-known financial institution (Maybank) for educational and awareness purposes only.

Objective
The project aims to:

Highlight the techniques scammers use to create fraudulent websites.
Demonstrate common vulnerabilities exploited in phishing attacks.
Educate users on recognizing and avoiding scams in a secure digital environment.
Features
Imitative Design: Replicates a financial institution's visual identity, including the logo, color scheme, and user interface.
Fake Login Form: Includes input fields for a username and password, which, when submitted, redirects users to a YouTube video instead of collecting sensitive data.
Deceptive Navigation Bar: Mimics real website navigation but lacks actual functionality.
Scam Awareness Section: Displays icons and links to raise awareness about scams, subtly highlighting the educational nature of the project.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the website.
CSS3: For styling and creating a realistic yet deceptive design.
FontAwesome: For icons enhancing the fake interface.
JavaScript: To simulate interactivity and demonstrate redirection techniques.
Usage
Simulating the Scam:
Users can interact with the fake login form, which redirects them to a YouTube video exposing the scam nature of the site.
Awareness and Education:
Replace the current redirect URL with educational content about online security or phishing awareness if needed.
Customization:
Replace assets like images to simulate different institutions or create a broader phishing education toolkit.
How It Relates to Multimedia Forensics
Analysis of Phishing Techniques: Demonstrates the replication of branding, UI elements, and interactivity to deceive users.
Digital Investigation Training: Helps users and forensic professionals understand how to identify and dissect fraudulent websites.
Awareness Campaigns: Educates users about the dangers of sharing sensitive information on unsecured platforms.
Educational Disclaimer
This project is intended strictly for educational purposes under the Multimedia Forensic and Security course. It is not an actual phishing tool and should not be used for malicious purposes.
